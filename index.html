    <h2><a href="#h_arabic_script_overview">Hebrew Script Overview</a></h2>
    <p>This section introduces the Hebrew script in general terms, providing some context and terminology that is useful in the remainder of the document. If possible, it's best not to introduce actual requirements in this section, but to leave those and detailed descriptions of expected typography to the sections that follow.</p>
    <p>Is the script an alphabet, abugida, abjad, syllabary, etc? What are the basic set of characters for major languages written in the script? How does the script work? Are glyphs in the script regularly joined up, as in Arabic, or not? Are there other special features, such as stacking, syllabic clusters and conjuncts, etc. Is there a set of characters used for special purposes, such as transcription? Are multiple scripts used? </p>
    <p>What are the basic directional features of the script? Is the script written right-to-left, or bidirectionally? Is is written vertically? If so, can it also be written horizontally, what is the frequency with which it is written one way or the other, and which side is the first line on?</p>
    <p> Are there special considerations about page layout that should be described briefly at this point, eg. Japanese kihon-hanmen?</p>

      <h3><a href="#h_digits">Numbers and digits</a></h3>
      <p>Does the script have its own set of number digits? How are they used, and how frequently? Does the numbering system use base-10, or some other type of base?</p>

      <h3><a href="#h_segmentation">Text segmentation</a></h3>
      <p>What are the basic units of the text, and how are they demarcated, eg. characters, character sequences, syllables, or words?  Are spaces or different symbols used between 'words'? Is it important to treat clusters of characters as a single unit?

Do you need to to convert between half-width and full-width presentation forms? <a href="index#transforming_characters">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Acharacter-transforms%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <section id="h_inline_spacing">
      <h3><a href="#h_inline_spacing">Inline spacing</a></h3>
      <p>Many scripts create emphasis or other effects by spacing out the letters or syllables in a word. We know there are questions here about how this should work in Indic and SE Asian scripts, and in Arabic-based scripts.  Can you provide information? Are there requirements for other scripts that we should add? See <a href="index#letter_spacing">available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainline-spacing%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <section id="h_ruby">
      <h3><a href="#h_ruby">Ruby annotation</a></h3>
      <p>The ruby spec currently specifies an initial subset of requirements for fine-tuning the typography of phonetic and semantic annotations of East Asian text, including furigana, pinyin and zhuyin fuhao systems.  Is is adequate for what it sets out to do?  What other controls will be needed in the future? <a href="index#ruby_annotation">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aruby%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <section id="h_text_decoration">
      <h3><a href="#h_text_decoration">Text decoration</a></h3>
      <p>Some aspects related to the drawing of lines alongside or through text involve local typographic considerations. For example, underlines need to be broken in special ways for some scripts, and the height of strike-through may vary depending on the script. What about vertical text? <a href="index#text_decoration">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Atext-decoration%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="h_emphasis">
      <h3><a href="#h_emphasis">Emphasis</a></h3>
      <p>Bold and italic are not always appropriate for expressing emphasis, and some scripts have their own unique ways of doing it, that are not in the Western tradition at all. <a href="index#emphasis">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aemphasis%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

      <h3><a href="#h_line_breaking">Line breaking</a></h3>
      <p>Does CSS capture the rules about the way text in your script wraps when it hits the end of a line?  What characters should not appear at the end or start of a line, and what should be done to prevent that? Does line-breaking wrap whole 'words' at a time, or characters, or something else (such as syllables in Tibetan)? <a href="index#line_breaking">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aline-break%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

      <h3><a href="#h_justification">Justification &amp; line-end alignment</a></h3>
      <p> When text in a paragraph needs to have flush lines down both sides, does it follow the rules for your script? Does the script conform to a grid pattern? 
        Does your script allow punctuation to hang outside the text box at the start or end of a line? Where adjustments are need to make a line flush, how is that done? Do you shrink/stretch space between words and/or letters? Are word baselines stretched, as in Arabic? <a href="index#justification">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ajustification%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <h3><a href="#h_counters">Counters, lists, etc</a></h3>
    <p>The CSS Counter Styles specification describes a limited set of simple and complex styles for counters to be used in list numbering, chapter heading numbering, etc. Are the details correct?
      We have another document that provides over 120 templates for user-defined counter styles in over 30 scripts. Are there more? Are there other aspects related to counters and lists that need to be addressed? <a href="index#counters">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Acounters%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>
